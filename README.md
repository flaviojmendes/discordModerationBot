### Discord Moderator

This is a bot that is being build in a series of videos for my Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV6DDiXhBJqT-hLQ6_ZCNiA

The bot Moderates blacklisted words and potentially offensive images.


To run:

`$ pip install`

You need the following environment variables set:

```
DISCORD_API_KEY=
CLARIFAI_API_KEY=
```

And then:

`$ python main.py`
